GDP and Population Analysis Project
Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and population data from various regions. By employing advanced clustering techniques and time series analysis, the goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights within the economic and demographic data. The project not only provides a detailed examination of economic growth but also explores the interplay between GDP and population dynamics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure a seamless setup by installing the required tools:

- **R and RStudio**: Essential for running the project scripts.
- **R Libraries**: Install necessary R libraries by executing the following command in the R console:

```R
install.packages(c("cluster", "readr", "dplyr", "readxl", "ggplot2", "forecast", "tseries", "corrplot", "TSA"))
```
Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gdp-population-analysis.git
   cd gdp-population-analysis
   
2. Open the R script (DS.R) in RStudio and execute the code.

##Usage
Run the provided R script to initiate the analysis. Customize input parameters and file paths within the script for your specific use case.
```R
read.excel("(path)DS.R")
```
##Data
The dataset, sourced from "GDP_and_Major_Industrial_Sectors_of_Economy_Dataset.xlsx," contains a rich array of economic indicators. Preprocessing involves meticulous cleaning and conversion to ensure data integrity throughout the analysis.

##Clustering
Utilizing the k-means clustering algorithm, the project categorizes regions based on their economic characteristics. The resulting clusters are subjected to in-depth analysis, shedding light on GDP patterns and growth rates.

##Time Series Analysis
Time series analysis is conducted on GDP and population data using ARIMA models. This involves checking for stationarity, performing differencing, fitting ARIMA models, and forecasting future values to capture nuanced economic trends.

##Results
The analysis culminates in visually compelling results, including trend visualizations, population dynamics, and forecasted values. The insights derived from the analysis are meticulously summarized, providing a clear narrative of the economic landscape.

##Contributing
Contributions to the project are highly encouraged. Whether you wish to report bugs, request features, or contribute to the codebase, please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines.
